# Setting up M4 baselines
- [x] Research: How is 4M evaluated?
- [ ] Decide: 4M baseline evaluation, that is reasonable to replicate
- [ ] Implement, compatible to HPC

# Foul Recognition Challenge
- [ ] Decide on useful output format (head on language tokens,...)
- [ ] Implement baseline: Aggregation
- [ ] Implement adaptation of 4M pretrained for changed input

# Advanced Time Tokenization
- [ ] Develop training strategy that does not rely on heavy 4M inference
